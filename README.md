# RL-Paper-Reviews
One page summary/review of research papers read by me in Reinforcement Learning along with possible improvements which I could think of.



| Paper         | Authors        | Conference/Journal  | Authors Affiliation |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----:|
| [Object Sensitive Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06064) | Y.Li, K.Sycara, R.Iyer | GCAI-17  | Carnegie Mellon University |
| [Safe Reinforcement Learning with Model Uncertainty Estimates](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08700) | B.Lutjens, M.Everett, J.How      | ICRA-18 | Massachusetts Institute of Technology |


## Reason for writing paper summaries/review:
* Writing paper summaries/reviews does help me in retaining the information in the paper and understanding it in a better way as it makes me think more about the paper which I would not have done by just reading the papers. 
* It also helps me to think of possible extensions of the project by connecting information in the previously read papers and trying to combine the positives of all the papers.
* Motivates me to read more papers.
