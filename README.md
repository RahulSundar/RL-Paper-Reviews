# RL-Paper-Reviews
One-two page summary/review of research papers read by me in Reinforcement Learning along with possible improvements which I could think of.

## Reason for writing paper summaries/review:
* Writing paper summaries/reviews does help me in retaining the information in the paper and understanding it in a better way as it makes me think more about the paper which I would not have done by just reading the papers. 
* It also helps me to think of possible extensions of the project by connecting information in the previously read papers and trying to combine the positives of all the papers.
* Motivates me to read more papers.


## Disclaimer:
The paper review/summary contains ideas which I could think of when I read the paper. The ideas/extensions may or may not work. They are just to make me think more about the paper. I do not intend to insult or degrade any of the authors' work.
